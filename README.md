# Employee-Log
This is just an UI that takes input from the user and places it into a local sql database (you'll have to make the database atm,
I will be adding features to make it download and play later) It also has buttons that allow the user to add new data, and edit or delete existing
data. 
I have made this public on purpose, to allow other beginners like myself get involved with something more simple, so if you have stumbled 
on this and want to gain experience or are already experienced and want to give some insight then you're more than welcome too. Thanks!
